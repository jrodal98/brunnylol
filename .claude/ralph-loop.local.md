Execute on all phases of the plan. An iteration should not stop until all phases are address and cargo test is passing all tests.

[RALPH LOOP INSTRUCTIONS]:
1. SINGLE CUMULATIVE REPORT: /tmp/ralph-execute-on-all-phases-of-the-plan-an-iteration-sh-20260130-145449-report.md
2. Each iteration UPDATES the same file with:
   - Validation of ALL previous findings (check accuracy, completeness)
   - New findings from current iteration
   - Cumulative progress tracking
3. After completing this iteration's work, MUST exit the session to trigger the next iteration
4. Do NOT wait for user input - exit when iteration work is complete
5. Next iteration will validate all previous work and continue improving

📊 FIRST ITERATION - COMPLEXITY ESTIMATION (Priority 2: Dynamic Limits):
In Iteration 1, you MUST include a complexity assessment in the report:

### Complexity Estimation (Iteration 1 Only)
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Task Scope | Small (1-3 files) / Medium (4-10 files) / Large (10+ files) |
| Expected Findings | Few (<10) / Moderate (10-30) / Many (30+) |
| Validation Depth | Surface / Standard / Deep |
| Estimated Iterations | N iterations recommended |

**Suggested max-iterations**: Based on complexity, recommend a limit.
- Small/Few/Surface: 3-5 iterations
- Medium/Moderate/Standard: 5-8 iterations
- Large/Many/Deep: 8-15 iterations

This helps calibrate expectations and catch runaway loops early.

🔒 REPORT-ONLY MODE (--auto-fix not specified):
- DO NOT make any changes to files
- ONLY report and document issues found
- Propose fixes but DO NOT implement them
- All issues remain as ⏳ PENDING VALIDATION (never fixed)
- This is useful for review/audit tasks where you want analysis without modifications

[CUMULATIVE REPORT FORMAT - APPEND MODE]:
The report is structured chronologically with oldest first, newest at bottom.
A FINAL SUMMARY section at the end consolidates all findings.

```markdown
# Ralph Loop - Cumulative Validation Report

**Task**: [Brief description]
**Started**: [Timestamp]
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (update to ✅ COMPLETE when done)

---

## Iteration Log (APPEND MODE - oldest first, newest at bottom)

### Iteration 1 (2026-01-30T22:54:49Z)

#### Work Completed
[What you discovered/accomplished]

#### Findings
1. Finding 1 - ⏳ Pending validation
2. Finding 2 - ⏳ Pending validation

#### Issues/Blockers
[Any problems encountered]

#### Next Steps
[What the next iteration should focus on]

---
<!-- APPEND new iterations BELOW this line -->
<!-- Oldest iterations at TOP, newest at BOTTOM -->

---

## FINAL SUMMARY (UPDATE EACH ITERATION)
<!-- This section is ALWAYS at the END of the report -->
<!-- Update with cumulative status from ALL iterations -->

**Current Iteration**: 1
**Last Updated**: [Timestamp]

### All Findings (Cumulative)
[List ALL findings from ALL iterations with validation status]

### Issues Found
[List any blocking issues or problems discovered]

### Final Recommendation
[Overall assessment and next steps]
```

CRITICAL RULES FOR REPORT UPDATES:
1. APPEND MODE: Add new iteration sections at the BOTTOM (before FINAL SUMMARY)
2. Oldest iterations at top, newest at bottom (chronological order)
3. FINAL SUMMARY is ALWAYS at the END - update it each iteration
4. Validate ALL previous findings by reading through the report
5. Mark findings with confidence: ✅ HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW CONFIDENCE | 🔄 Corrected | ❌ Invalid | ⏳ Pending
6. If report exceeds 500KB, summarize OLDEST iterations at the top (keep newest detailed)

🔒 REPORT-ONLY MODE RULES:
7. DO NOT modify any files - only report issues
8. ALL problems stay as ⏳ PENDING VALIDATION (never implement fixes)
9. Document proposed fixes in the report but DO NOT implement them
10. This mode is for review/audit only - no changes allowed
