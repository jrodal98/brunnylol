# brunnylol

Like bunnylol, but made with Rust.

## How to use

* See <https://brunnylol.xyz>
* See list of commands on <https://brunnylol.xyz/help>
* Search `<alias> <query>`, where `alias` is the shortname for the bookmark (e.g. the alias for Google is g).

## Contributing

Submit an issue request with bookmark ideas or add the bookmark in `src/bookmarks.rs` and the alias to bookmark mapping in `src/utils.rs`.
